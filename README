Prerequisites -
  Marklogic is installed with HTTP server configured on 9995.

This is a scala play application which uses Marklogic.
It demonstrates how we can use Marklogic to build a dynamic query builder.

This application has two endpoints -
  1. Dynamic Search - User can give multiple search options like what temperature / pressure range he is interested in
  under what environment. Given these inputs, output of endpoint will be xml's fulfilling these multiple dynamic
  search criteria's.

  2. Context Finder - Given a search term, how we can identify context from it. e.g If search term is Gold,
  output of this endpoint will be Gold -> Material.

How to use this application -
1. Install xquery modules in Marklogic from xquery folder.
2. Ingest sample xmls from sampleData folder into Marklogic.
3. Run export-env-variables script.
4. Start play server and hit endpoints specified in routes file.
